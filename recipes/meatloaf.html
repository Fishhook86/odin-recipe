<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This classic Meatloaf Recipe is just like Mom used to make: baked as a free-form loaf and brushed with a ketchup glaze. It’s delicious for dinner and just as good as leftovers the next day (meatloaf sandwich, anyone?).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ground Beef</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
    <li>Ketchup</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup. In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl by hand, combine beef, onion, eggs, breadcrumbs, ½ cup ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Mix on low until combined.</li>
    <li>Rinse a 9-inch by 5-inch loaf pan with water (to help the meatloaf release). Pour the meat mixture into the pan and pack it tightly.</li>
    <li>Flip the pan over the prepared baking sheet and jiggle carefully until the meatloaf slides out.</li>
    <li>Bake 60 minutes and remove from oven. Increase oven temp to 400 degrees. Brush remaining ¼ cup ketchup on all sides of the meatloaf.</li>
    <li>Return to oven and bake 10 minutes longer. The meatloaf should register an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees F when tested with a meat thermometer.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and cool 15 minutes before slicing. </li>
</ol>
